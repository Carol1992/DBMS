## :sparkles: Remarks
:punch: I did not learn too much about computer science or programming, instead, I learn how to learn by yourself after graduate from college.
I spent almost all my spare in the CS world, I enrolled in some very famous courses and get certificates, and I will keep doing that. CS is
really very funny and challenge, keep learning and coding so that you won't left behind. I also write some technical articals or do some 
translation job. Any way, I love CS and I need a job.
