## TODOs

1. Hey I learn how to upload photos by dragging into the dropzone, and display all the photos under the dropzone, more details from this web: http://experimentsinmeteor.com/photo-blog-part-1/ .

2. But that's not enough, I decide to create a photos blog, where users can create photos-blog. Users can post their blogs as private or public, and can access all the public blogs in the Blog page, and can access all their public or private blogs in their Profile page. Also we may have a Home page.

3. And now we already finish the uploading steps and it works very well with Amazon S3. The next step is learn how to make the user interface looks awesome, and I need to learn more.
